## Setup

### Prerequisites

To set up the guestbook, you'll need:

- **Python 3.x** installed on your system.
- **Supabase Account:** Sign up at [https://supabase.io](https://supabase.io) if you haven't already.
- **Supabase Project:** Create a new project in Supabase and note down your project URL and API key.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sven-Bo/fasthtml-guestbook-supabase.git
   cd fasthtml-guestbook-supabase
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   Install the required Python packages using \`pip\`:

   ```bash
   pip install supabase-py python-dotenv pytz fasthtml
   ```

3. **Set Up Supabase:**

   - Create a new table named `guestbook` in your Supabase project with the following columns:
     - `id` (int8, primary key)
     - `name` (text)
     - `message` (text)
     - `timestamp` (text)

   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your project with the following content:
     ```
     SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
     SUPABASE_KEY=your_supabase_api_key
     ```
   Replace `your_supabase_project_url` and `your_supabase_api_key` with your actual Supabase project URL and API key.

4. **Run the Application:**

   Start the server by running:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   Visit `http://localhost:5001` in your browser to see the guestbook in action.
