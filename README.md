## Setup

### Prerequisites

To set up the guestbook, you'll need:

- **Python 3.x** installed on your system.
- **Google Sheets API** and **Google Drive API** enabled on your Google account.
- **Credentials JSON File:** A `credentials.json` file is required to authenticate with the Google Sheets API. If you haven't set this up yet, a quick tutorial will be provided to guide you through the process.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sven-Bo/fasthtml-guestbook.git
   cd yourrepository
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies:**

   Install the required Python packages using `pip`:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set Up Google Sheets API:**

   - Enable the Google Sheets API and Google Drive API in your Google Cloud Console.
   - Download the `credentials.json` file and place it in the root directory of your project.
   - Share your Google Sheets document with the email address listed in the `credentials.json` file.

4. **Run the Application:**

   Start the server by running:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   Visit `http://localhost:5001` in your browser to see the guestbook in action.
